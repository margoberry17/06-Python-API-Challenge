WeatherPy
1. I created a Python script to visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator, using the OpenWeatherMap API.
   
2. I created a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:
    -Latitude vs. Temperature
    -Latitude vs. Humidity
    -Latitude vs. Cloudiness
    -Latitude vs. Wind Speed

3. I computed the linear regression for each relationship. I separate the plots into Northern Hemisphere (greater than or equal to 0 degrees latitude) and Southern Hemisphere (less than 0 degrees latitude).

4. I created a series of scatter plots (listed below) and included the linear regression line, the model's formula, and the r-values.
create the following plots:
    -Northern Hemisphere: Temperature vs. Latitude
    -Southern Hemisphere: Temperature vs. Latitude
    -Northern Hemisphere: Humidity vs. Latitude
    -Southern Hemisphere: Humidity vs. Latitude
    -Northern Hemisphere: Cloudiness vs. Latitude
    -Southern Hemisphere: Cloudiness vs. Latitude
    -Northern Hemisphere: Wind Speed vs. Latitude
    -Southern Hemisphere: Wind Speed vs. Latitude

VacationPy
I used the Geoapify API and the geoViews Python library and employed my Python skills to create map visualizations
1. I create a map that displays a point for every city in my DataFrame.
   
2. I narrowed down the DataFrame to find my ideal weather condition for a vacation.

3. I created a new DataFrame to store the city, country, coordinates, and humidity. 

4. For each city, I used the Geoapify API to find the first hotel located within 10,000 meters of my coordinates.

5. Then I added the hotel name and the country as additional information in the hover message for each city on the map and stored the information in the new DataFrame.
